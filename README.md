## Password checker

The Password Checker section allows you to check whether your password is strong enough.

- Step 1: I check whether your password is in my database of the most frequently used passwords.
- Step 2: I check that your password has not already been leaked via the [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) website.  
- Step 3: I check whether your password is strong enough by calculating its entropy.

## Password generator

The Password Generator section allows you to generate a strong password.

- Step 1: it tells you the size of your password, which must be at least 12 characters long, as this is the minimum for a good password.
- Step 2: It generates an "insane" password, containing capital letters, numbers and special characters.
- Step 3: it will check that this password is not a secure password by submitting it to my password checker.

## Password generator with sentence

For the phrase password generator, simply enter a phrase such as "The pink kitten" and the program will generate a password using this phrase. It will also check whether the password in question is secure enough.
